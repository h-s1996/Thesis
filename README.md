# Thesis
## Software for the Natural Language Processing and Utterance Generation system

#### The Software used in the final system of this thesis is under the directory *"final"*

In the other directories it is possible to find the other trials that led up to the final proposal.

In the directory **scripts** there are a couple of scripts that serve the following purposes:
1. **script_alpha** - test multiple values of the Laplace Smoothing Parameter on the final performance.
2. **script_class_labels_analysis** - test the influence of a different number of class labels on the final performance.
3. **script_mfreq_ngram_peig** - test the influence of Minimum Document Frequency, Maximum N-Gram and Percentage of Cumulative Eigenvalues on the final performance.
4. **script_output_analysis_false** - show utterances wrongly predicted by the system and the total probabilites, class probabilites and likelihood probabilites of the correct and predicted phrases.
5. **script_output_analysis_true** - show a dialogue correctly predicted by the system.
6. **script_results** - display the values of the performance of the final system.
7. **script_speak_with_the_robot** - program to use the complete software.
8. **script_train_elements_analysis** - test the influence of a different number of training utterances per class on the final performance.
